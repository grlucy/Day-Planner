# Day-Planner

## Description

A calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. I made this site fully responsive through Bootstrap. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/Day-Planner/

This web browser application is intended for use as a daily schedule planner to keep track of important events, meetings, and deadlines during the work day on an hourly basis. It enables professionals to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.

Technologies used:
> HTML, Git, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Moment.js

## Usage

Users can employ this day planner to find the current date and time and to write and save activities, events, meetings, deadlines, tasks, etc. in hourly timeslots during standard business hours. When the save button is clicked, text in the corresponding textarea is saved to localStorage. Saved text persists when the application is refreshed.
